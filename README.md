# portfolio-website
This repository is directly connected to the URL (jjdevs.co.uk)

The repo and domain are for my "portfolio site" which is a site introducing myself and my skills. Contained in it are links to some of my favourite projects.

This repo is a very simple one and the site is made up of a html, css and js files. Preprocessor of SASS has also been added.
